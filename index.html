            <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Tool Rental Service</h2>
            <p>
                We all have a hidden handyman inside us ‚Äî the desire to fix, build, and create. But often, we‚Äôre held back by one simple thing: lack of tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                That‚Äôs where this idea was born ‚Äî if we can rent big things like cars and homes, why not the small tools that empower us to do more?
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it‚Äôs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Applying ceramic coating to your car at home</li>
                    <li>Replacing a capacitor in your AC</li>
                    <li>Fixing a gear knob on your appliance</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are countless DIY videos online, but without the right tools, they‚Äôre just ideas. Instead of borrowing from friends and feeling obligated, you can now rent tools at a very affordable price and become your own handyman.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why Rent?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inspire your kids by showing them what you can build (I‚Äôll even share a photo with Rishaa!)</li>
                    <li>No more awkward borrowing ‚Äî be independent</li>
                    <li>Turn DIY into a hobby (just like I did!)</li>
                    <li>Learn, fix, and create ‚Äî all on your own terms</li>
                </ul>
